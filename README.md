# Character-Regonition
This repo consists of perceptron based algorithm to detect the character 'C' from a given input.
The input given is 5x5 matrix <br /> For e.g., <br />
input matrix of 'C' is <br />
-1     1    1    1    1 <br />
 1    -1   -1   -1   -1 <br />
 1    -1   -1   -1   -1 <br />
 1    -1   -1   -1   -1 <br />
-1     1    1    1    1 <br />

'C' can also be represented as <br />
 1     1    1    1    1 <br />
 1    -1   -1   -1   -1 <br />
 1    -1   -1   -1   -1 <br />
 1    -1   -1   -1   -1 <br />
 1     1    1    1    1 <br />
